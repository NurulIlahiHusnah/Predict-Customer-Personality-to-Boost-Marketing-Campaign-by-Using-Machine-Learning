The sample obtained from the results of the K-Means algorithm is 3 clusters, namely:
1. High Spender
2. Medium Spender
3. Risk Of Churn Spender
<br>

# Business Recommendations <br>
With the above results for business recommendations that can be used:

1. Enhance the campaign in terms of concept, visualization, and other aspects to adjust deals purchases targeting the median spender and risk churn spender clusters.
2. In terms of the business ecosystem and marketing, among the four concepts mentioned above, there is a need for further improvement in deals purchases to continually strengthen the ecosystem. This can be achieved through offering promotions, shopping vouchers, free shipping, or other discounts to boost sales.
